# XIS
KS Image Suite will combine my previous graphical projects into a single project. Including deleting similar images, aggressive image compression and scanner helper.

## Features
* image-copy-finder - looks for similar images in folder, shows them to user and lets them delete (move to other folder) selected ones
* scanner-to-note - color quantization of  images and scaling their brightness in order to create better notes
* high-pass-filter - removing gradients and background from photos and scans
* automated filtering - same as high-pass-filter but for .pdf files

## Planned features
* tournament mode for images
* custom compression
* ulam-spiral-generator - generating ulam spirals
* spritesheet-builder - connecting single textures into a single spritesheet
* possibly more
