# XIS
KS Image Suite will combine my previous graphical projects into a single project. Including deleting similar images, agressive image compression and scanner helper.

## Features
* image-copy-finder - looks for similar images in folder, shows them to user and lets them delete (move to other folder) selected ones
* scanner-to-note - posterizing images and scaling their brightness in order to create better notes
* high-pass-filter - removing gradients and background from photos and scans

## Planned features
* tournament mode for images
* custom compression
* ulam-spiral-generator - generating ulam spirals
* spritesheet-builder - connecting single textures into a single spritesheet, following simple rules
* possibly more
