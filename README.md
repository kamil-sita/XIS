# XIS
KS Image Suite will combine my previous graphical projects into a single project. Including deleting similar images, agressive image compression and scanner helper.

## Planned featues
* image-copy-finder - looks for similar images in folder, shows them to user and lets them delete (move to other folder) selected ones
* spritesheet-builder - connecting single textures into a single spritesheet, following simple rules
* lossy-steganography-image-compression - aggressive compression of image into only 3 bits (1 for R, G, B). Could be useful for steganography
* scanner-helper - converting images and photos into pictures that are easier to print for black&white printers
* ulam-spiral-generator - generating ulam spirals
* possibly more
