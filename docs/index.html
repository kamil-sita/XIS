<h3>Image copy finder</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Image copy finder attempts to find copies of images in folders selected by the user. After initial scan
should any pairs of similar-looking images be found, they are displayed to the user, who can decide
to move one of them into user-selected "delete" folder or hide that pair.
    <h4>Syntax:</h4>

    <b>Simple queries:</b> <br/>
    Put each folder into different line: <br/>
    <code>C:\example folder <br/>
        C:\example folder2</code><br/><br/>

    <b>Recursive queries:</b> <br/>
    Put a plus sign before folder which you want to open recursively: <br/>
    <code>+C:\example folder <br/>
        C:\example folder2</code><br/>
    "example folder" will be opened recursively. All folders found recursively are considered to be the same as parent folder during comparison (they belong in the same group).<br/><br/>

    <b>Local queries</b> <br/>
    If contents of one folder should be compared only locally (within this group), put at "L" the start of the line: <br/>
    <code>L +C:\example folder <br/>
        L C:\example folder2</code><br/>
    Contents of "example folder" will not be compared with contents of "example folder2".<br/><br/>

    <b>Global queries</b> <br/>
    If contents of one folder should be compared only globally (with files from outside this group), put "G" at the start of the line: <br/>
    <code>G +C:\example folder <br/>
        G C:\example folder2 <br/>
        L +C:\example folder3
    </code><br/>
    Contents of "example folder" will be compared with contents of "example folder2" but not "example folder3". Contents of "example folder" and "example folder2" will not be compared locally.<br/><br/>

    <b>Join groups</b> <br/>
    If you want for a list of folders to behave like a one folder put "JOIN (" at the start of the group and ")" at the end: <br/>
    <code>
        JOIN ( <br/>
        +C:\example folder <br/>
        C:\example folder2 <br/>
        )
    </code> <br/>
    Both operators need to be the only things in their line. Folders inside of group cannot have local or global modifiers. <br/>
    Joined folders behave like a single folder. Local or global modifier can be placed before "JOIN (": <br/>
    <code>
        C:\example folder3 <br/>
        G JOIN ( <br/>
        +C:\example folder <br/>
        +C:\example folder2 <br/>
        )
    </code> <br/>
    Contents of "example folder3" will be compared with contents of "example folder" and "example folder2" as if the latter were a single folder.
    <br/>

<h4>How it works:</h4>
Image copy finder (ICF) works in two phases:<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Finding and preparing images</li>
    During this phase ICF looks for images in given folders. For all of the images, it scaled them down, and if
    alternative mode is selected, blur them.
    This allows for elimination of artifacts caused by compression. <br/> <br/>

    <li>Comparing images</li>
    All of the processed images are compared with each other on pixel-by-pixel basis. If they are similar enough, they
    are added as a pair to list containing similar images.
</ol>
After completing those two phases images displayed to the user.

<h3>Image compression</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Image compression uses my custom lossy compression algorithm to compress images. It uses a combination of chroma
subsampling, dictionary compression and RLE compression. Additional improvements are planned.
<h4>File structure:</h4>
Best way to describe algorithm is to describe its file structure:
<ol>
    <li>Header</li>
    Header contains information about:
    <ol>
        <li>Algorithm name</li>
        <li>Version that this file was compressed with</li>
        <li>Last version that can decode this file</li>
        <li>Flags (currently unused)</li>
        <li>Width</li>
        <li>Height</li>
        <li>Block size - image is divided into blocks of this size</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Blocks:</li>
    Each block describes Y, Cb or Cr layer in YCbCr color space.
    Each block contains information about:
    <ol>
        <li>Dictionary</li>
        Dictionary is generated using K-Means algorithm and Y and CbCr weights provided by user. Contains:
        <ol>
            <li>Dictionary size</li>
            <li>Y/Cb/Cr values ordered by ID</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Compressed lines</li>
        Each of the lines is compressed using one of the compression algorithms:
        <ol>
            <li>RLE</li>
            RLE handles simple cases where only one or two colors are used and they exists simple way to describe them.
            <li>Differential</li>
            Differential handles most cases. If value is the same as the last value, only "REPEAT" information is
            encoded.
            <li>Simple</li>
            Simple handles basic cases, where only two values are present. In those cases using differential method
            would always lead to increase in compressed file size.
        </ol>
    </ol>
</ol>

<h3>Scanner to note</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Scanner to note attempts to convert scanned images into ones that are easier to read.
<h4>How it works:</h4>
Based on: <a href ="https://mzucker.github.io/2016/09/20/noteshrink.html">https://mzucker.github.io/2016/09/20/noteshrink.html</a>

<div>
<h3>High pass filter</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Similar to Scanner to note. Attempts to remove gradients and backgrounds from images/scans/photos.
<h4>How it works:</h4>
High pass filter. That's all.
</div>
<hr/>

<div>
<h3>Automated filter</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Works exactly like High pass filter but allows to use .pdf files instead.
